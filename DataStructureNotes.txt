keys for data in app.py in create_zip_report (contains pretty much everything)

? **Seems like a mix of dataframes and dictionaries, maybe pick one?**

'results_table' -> Dataframe? for the normalized intensities
	dict (Dataset), list (0 or 1 -headers?), list (each peak?), dict (columns of table of fit and theoretical intensities)


'phase_frac' -> Dataframe? for Table of Phase Fractions (deprecated?)
	dict (Dataset), list (0 or 1 -headers?), list (each phase)


 'volume_conversion',-> Dataframe? for Table of Phase Fractions after conversion to volume fraction (deprecated?)
	dict (Dataset), list (0 or 1 -headers?), list (each phase)

 'mass_conversion', -> Dataframe? for Table of Phase Fractions after conversion to volume fraction (deprecated?)
	dict (Dataset), list (0 or 1 -headers?), list (each phase)

'two_thetas', -> Dict/List for the list of two theta values
	dict (Dataset), list (length of dataset)

'ti_tables', -> Theoretical intensities calculated
	dict (Dataset), list (0 or 1 -headers?), dict (each peak?),

'uncert', -> Dataframe? for the different flags  ** Should rename **
	dict (Dataset), list (0 or 1 -headers?),


?** I don't see where any alterations are made.  Why do we have these?**
'altered_results', 
	dict (Dataset), list (0 or 1 -headers?),
'altered_phase', 
'altered_ti', 


'fit_points', -> list of lists returned from 'compute' in compute_results.  Histogram data, fit of background, fit of data
	dict (Dataset), list (0 or 1 -headers?), list (??? Shape is 3, 4145)

'interaction_vol_data', -> depth profile of interaction parameters.  Comes from compute_summarized_phase_info ?!?
	dict (Phase), list (each peak?), list (???), list (Dataframe? 0 or 1 -headers?), different depths?

'cell_masses_dict', -> masses of each cell, as a dictionary with phase name
	dict (Phase), summed mass (atomic mass units)

'cell_volumes_dict', 

'cell_mass_vec', -> masses of each cell, as a list (no phase names)

'cell_volume_vec', 

'mu_samps', 
	dict (Phase, but only numbered?)
? Why isn't this also separated by Dataset?
? Looks like the names (phase_mu[1] phase_mu[2]) come from Stan. Any way to rename them?

'param_table', -> Sources of Uncertainty table
	dict (each row is the phase, with column names)

 'crystallites' _ 
	dict (Phase), list (Peak)
