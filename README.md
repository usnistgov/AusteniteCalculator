# AusteniteCalculator



follow format from Library?
https://inet.nist.gov/announcement/readme
I thought there was one for GitHub too...

## Example data

Data from L210209-MRC-001
- Gonio_BB-HD-Cu_Gallipix3d[30-120]_New_Control_proper power.xrdml

Used inital data to create calibration file 'TestCalibration.instprm'
- Not a recommended method...

### CIF files
These are files that describe the lattice information and composition information

Two files are included for each phase, austenite and ferrite.
Duplex steel (B160506-AAC-001), composition from E160629-AAC-004.
Bulk composition used for each, no alloying segregation by phase calculated.
- austenite-Duplex.cif
- ferrite-Duplex.cif
